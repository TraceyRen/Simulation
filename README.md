# Investigation of Simulation Models in Infectious Disease Spreading
Public clone of previous private project on simulation.

## Abstract
Studying how infectious disease spread and constructing simulation models can provide insights into how epidemics spread through populations helping us to develop effective strategies for controlling outbreaks, and reducing the number of people infected by diseases. Therefore, the goal of this project is studying the disease spread system under different simulated settings, and exploring the simulation model applications in the real-world diseases or other social behaviors that have the similar disease-spreading process.

## Project Discription
Understanding how infectious diseases spread can help us to develop effective strategies for controlling outbreaks, and reducing the number of people infected by diseases. Simulations can provide insights into how epidemics spread through populations and can incorporate various environmental factors. With simulation models, it is easier for researchers to evaluate the impact of different interventions and strategies.
In addition, the spread of information, cultural norms and other social behaviors can be conceptually modeled as a disease-spreading process. The similarity between the mathematical descriptions of disease-spreading and other phenomena let the epidemic modeling be widely researched and become a field crossing different disciplines.

## Models
We created 3 models in this study: SIR, Cellular Automata, and Network Model.
